    <h2>Where we're going, we don't need teeth</h2>
        <p>Last summer my dentist told me that in order to prevent more cavities from forming and repeat visits to the office, I would need to cut back on sugar. <em>"Cut back on sugar!"</em> In retrospect, having the equivalent of a blown out '67 Chevy Pickup with a carb that's never been cleaned for teeth probably warranted some extra caution on the part of the dentist.</p>
        <p>So how about some <strong>dense</strong> and utterly <strong>gummy</strong> brownies to distract from thoughts like that!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>1 stick butter</li>
          <li>1/2 cup cocoa podwer</li>
          <li>1 14oz can sweetened condensed milk</li>
          <li>1 cup powdered sugar</li>
          <li>2 teaspoons vanilla</li>
          <li>2 teaspoons molasses</li>
          <li>1 egg yolk</li>
          <li>3/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
          <li>1 cup chocolate chip</li>
          </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
        <li>Preheat over to 325F and line a 9-inch square pan with parchment paper</li>
        <li>Melt the butter in a pot until it turns into brown butter</li>
        <li>When the butter smells like caramel, add in cocoa powder and keep on heat for one minute</li>
        <li>Whisk in sweetened condensed milk</li>
        <li>Then mix in powdered sugar until incorporeal</li>
        <li>Add in the salt, vanilla, egg yolk, and molasses</li>
        <li>Whisk in flour until just combined</li>
        <li>If you're adding chocolate chips, wait for the batter to cool or you'll have chocolate streaks</li>
        <li>Pour out into lined pan and chuck in the over for 30-40 minutes <strong>with the convection fan on</strong></li>
        <li>Let cool on a rack then eat</li>
        <li>Visit the dentist. <em>Again.</em></li>
</ol>
