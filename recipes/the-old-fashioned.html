<h2>The Last Drink You'll Ever Need</h2>
<p>This is a real recipe. I don't know how you found this deep in the bowels of my GitHub repositories but this is my Magnus Opum of drinks. I created this masterpiece of a libation in search of a drink I would be proud to call my own. With some inspiration from The Edison bar in Orlando and plenty of trial and error, I present my namesake (which, obviously you do not know..hopefully) <em><strong>Old Fashioned</strong></em></p>
