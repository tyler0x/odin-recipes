    <h2>Italy never tasted so close</h2>
    <p>In late 2019, I was hiking in the Austrian Alps with three friends and a pet mule. One brisk and crisp day, 
        the mule said to us, <em>"Team, we've been at this for about four hours now and some of you are looking rather ragged.
            How about we stop for the day, chaps?"</em> I looked at my friends, whose hair were all varying degrees of mangled from the South Alpine winds and whose skin were turning shades of blue not unlike my ex when I would explain my adventures on these trips. On hearing our Mule give rather prudent advice, my friends and I decided it was time to <strong>leave as soon as possible becuase Mules are not supposed to freaking talk.</strong>
